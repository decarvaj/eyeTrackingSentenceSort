# eyeTrackingSentenceSort
eye tracking sentence sort

This program will sort a dataset with sentence pairs by sentence order instead of word order. Also adds a column with the word number for the sentence pair.



Environment:
Using Windows 10, Python 3.6 (error using Mac OS with csv.reader)


The input should have a column with sentence one and another for sentence two. 
The sentence data needs to be in an CSV file format.
The sentence data needs to be named dataset.csv
The file dataset.csv and sentenceSortCSV.py need to be in the same folder to run.
The program sentenceSortCSV.py will generate a file named output.csv in the same folder as the program.
