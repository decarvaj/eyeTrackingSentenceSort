Steps to run sentenceSortCSV.py:
convert your data file into a .csv file format.
rename file to dataset.csv
place dataset.csv and sentenceSortCSV.py in the same folder.
run the sentenceSortCSV.py script.
look for the output.csv file in the same folder location.


Considerations:
the dataset requires the following columns: Subject, Item, Sentence1, Sentence2, and Word.
the column order doesn't matter.
all extra column data will be unaffected, and carried thru to the output.
Subject and Item should be unique for each sentence pair.
the starting state of each sentence pair should be based on the word position. (eg. word 1, word 1, word 2, word 2,...)
